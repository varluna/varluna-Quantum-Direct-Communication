##this project I developed during the Tuwaiq Academy Bootcamp with my team! ðŸš€

In todayâ€™s world, securely transferring sensitive data across various sectors is more critical than ever. While traditional encryption methods using keys are effective, they remain vulnerable to attackers and the growing threat of quantum computing advancements.

To tackle these challenges, I worked on building a Two-Step Quantum Direct Communication Protocol. This innovative protocol enhances security by enabling direct communication between two parties, eliminating many of the risks associated with conventional encryption methods.

It was an incredible experience exploring cutting-edge technology to address real-world vulnerabilities. Looking forward to applying these concepts to future challenges!"# varluna-Quantum-Direct-Communication
